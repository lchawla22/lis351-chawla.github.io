<h3> Who Am I?</h3>
<p> Hi! My name is Lavneet Chawla.
I am a 19 year old female studying at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
In my opinion, I would say that I am pretty unique.
This is because I have many different interests across plenty of areas.
This has allowed me explore many things and has brought me to be who I am today.</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to give a little background to who I am and what type of person I am! 
It's just a little project that I really enjoyed creating.
I hope it serves as a method of getting to know a little bit about me as a person!</p> <br> <br>

<div>
<input type="radio" id="yes" name="know_me" value="Yes">
<label for="yes">Yes</label> <br>
<input type="radio" id="not really" name="know_me" value="Not really">
<label for="not really">Not Really</label> <br>
<input type="radio" id="no" name="know_me" value="No">
<label for="no"> Nope</label>
